# Taco Town ðŸŒ®

Welcome to Taco Town, a simple Express.js application that allows users to select their favorite taco from a menu and view the recipe details, including ingredients and their quantities.

This project demonstrates the use of Express, EJS templating engine, and basic routing for handling user interactions.

## Project Overview

Taco Town lets users pick from three different types of tacos (Chicken, Beef, and Fish). Upon selection, the application displays the taco name, ingredients, and quantities for each taco, as well as its toppings. The application uses a mock JSON file to store taco recipes and uses EJS templates to render the content on the web page.

## Technologies Used

- **Node.js**: Server-side JavaScript runtime
- **Express.js**: Web framework for building the server and handling routes
- **EJS**: Templating engine for dynamic HTML rendering
- **Body-Parser**: Middleware to handle form data from POST requests
- **Path**: Core module for working with file and directory paths
